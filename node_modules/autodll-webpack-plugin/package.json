You know that, but Webpack doesn't. So every time it compiles it has to analyze and build them too - and that takes time.\n\nThe DllPlugin allows you to to create a separate bundle in advance for all of those modules, and teach Webpack to reference them to that bundle instead.\n\nThat leads to a dramatic reduction in the amount of time takes Webpack to build your bundles.\n\nFor example, these are the measurements for the  [performance test](examples/performance) that you can find in the [examples](examples) folder:\n\n|                   |  **Without DllPlugin**  | **With DllPlugin** |\n|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Build Time** | 16461ms - 17310ms | 2991ms - 3505ms |\n| **DevServer Rebuild** | 2924ms - 2997ms | 316ms - 369ms |\n\n\n\n### The DllPlugin sounds great! So why AutoDllPlugin?\n\nWhile the DllPlugin has many advantages, it's main drawback is that it requires a lot of boilerplate.\n\nAutoDllPlugin serves as a high-level plugin for both the DllPlugin and the DllReferencePlugin, and hides away most of their complexity.\n\nWhen you build your bundle for the first time, the AutoDllPlugin Compiles the DLL for you, and references all the specified modules from your bundle to the DLL.\n\nThe next time you compile your code, AutoDllPlugin will skip the build and read from the cache instead.\n\nAutoDllPlugin will rebuild your DLLs every time you change the Plugin's configuration, install or remove a node module.\n\nWhen using Webpack's Dev Server, the bundle are loaded into the memory preventing unnecessary reads from the FileSystem.\n\nWith the way the DLLPlugin works, you must load the DLL bundles before your own bundle. This is commonly accomplished by adding an additional script tag to the HTML.\n\nBecause that is such a common task, AutoDllPlugin can do this for you (in conjunction with the HtmlPlugin ).\n\n```js\nplugins: [\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n    inject: true,\n    template: './src/index.html',\n  }),\n  new AutoDllPlugin({\n    inject: true, // will inject the DLL bundles to index.html\n    filename: '[name].js',\n    entry: {\n      vendor: [\n        'react',\n        'react-dom'\n      ]\n    }\n  })\n]\n```\n\nWill Result in:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <title>Test</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n  ...\n\n  <script src=\"dist/vendor.dll.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"dist/main.bundle.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n### Basic Usage ([example](examples/basic)):\n\n```js\nconst path = require('path');\nconst AutoDllPlugin = require('autodll-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: {\n    app: './src/index.js'\n  },\n\n  output: {\n    filename: '[name].bundle.js',\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')\n    publicPath: '/'\n  },\n\n  plugins: [\n    new AutoDllPlugin({\n      filename: '[name].dll.js',\n      entry: {\n        vendor: [\n          'react',\n          'react-dom'\n        ]\n      }\n    })\n  ]\n};\n```\n\n### Recommended Usage ([example](examples/recommended)):\n\nWhile it's not required, using AutoDllPlugin together with [HtmlWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) is highly recommended, because its saves you the trouble of manually adding the DLL bundles to the HTML by yourself.\n\nUse AutoDllPlugin's `inject` option to enable this feature.\n\n```js\nconst path = require('path');\nconst AutoDllPlugin = require('autodll-webpack-plugin');\nconst HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: './src/index.js',\n\n  output: {\n    filename: '[name].bundle.js',\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),\n    publicPath: '/'\n  },\n\n  plugins: [\n    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n      inject: true, // will inject the main bundle to index.html\n      template: './src/index.html',\n    }),\n    new AutoDllPlugin({\n      inject: true, // will inject the DLL bundle to index.html\n      debug: true,\n      filename: '[name]_[hash].js',\n      path: './dll',\n      entry: {\n        vendor: [\n          'react',\n          'react-dom'\n        ]\n      }\n    })\n  ]\n};\n```\n\n## Options\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Option</th>\n            <th>Type</th>\n            <th>Default</th>\n

Why?\n\nWhen you run webpack for the first time, AutoDLL builds the DLL bundles and stores them in the cache for next time.\n\nThat leads to faster builds and rebuilds (using webpack's dev server).\n\nThere are two conditions for triggering a new build on the next run:\n1. Running `npm install / remove / update package-name` (or Yarn equivalent).\n2. Changing the plugin's configurations.\n\nFor performance considerations, AutoDLL is not aware of any changes made to module's files themselves.\n\nSo as long as you intend to work on a module, just exclude it from the DLL.\n\nFor example, let's say you configured the plugin like so:\n\n```js\nnew AutoDllPlugin({\n  entry: {\n    vendor: [\n      'react',\n      'react-dom',\n      'lodash'\n    ]\n  }\n})\n```\n\nAnd then, while working on your project, you encountered some weird behavior with `lodash` and decided to put a `console.log` statement in one of its files to see how it behaves.\n\nAs explained above, AutoDLL is not going to invalidate its cache in this case, and you might get surprised that you don't see the changes.\n\nTo fix that, all you have to do is comment out `lodash` from the DLL, and uncomment it when you're done.\n\n```js\nnew AutoDllPlugin({\n  entry: {\n    vendor: [\n      'react',\n      'react-dom'\n     // 'lodash'\n    ]\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n### The modules I added to the DLL are duplicated! They included both in the DLL bundle AND the main bundle.\n\nThat is most likely caused by using an incorrect context.\n\nAutoDLL will try its best to set the context for you, but as with [webpack's own context](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/entry-context/#context) property, sometimes it is better to do it manually.\n\nThe context property should be an absolute path, pointing the base of your project.\n\nFor example, let's consider a project structured like so:\n\n```\nmy-project\n├── node_modules\n│   └── react\n│   └── react-dom\n├── src\n│   └── index.js\n│   └── module.js\n├── webpack.config.js\n└── package.json\n```\n\nThen, inside `webpack.config.js`, You'll setup the context like so:\n\n```js\n__dirname;   // '/Users/username/my-project'\n\n...\n\nnew AutoDllPlugin({\n  context: __dirname,\n  entry: {\n    vendor: [\n      'react',\n      'react-dom'\n    ]\n  }\n})\n```\n\nNote that the `__dirname` variable is [node's way](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/globals.html#globals_dirname) to get the absolute path of the current module's directly, which is exactly what we need because webpack.config.js stored in the base of our project.\n\nOn the other hand, let's say your project is structured like so:\n\n```\nmy-project\n├── node_modules\n│   └── react\n│   └── react-dom\n├── src\n│   └── index.js\n│   └── module.js\n├── config\n│   └── webpack.config.js\n└── package.json\n```\n\nNotice that now our config is no longer stored at the base of our project, but in a subdirectory of its own. <br>\nThat means that now we have to subtract the relative path to our config file from `__dirname`.\n\nWe can use [node's path module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/path.html) to help us with that:\n\n```js\nvar path = require('path');\n\n__dirname;                   // '/Users/username/my-project/config'\npath.join(__dirname, '..');  // '/Users/username/my-project'\n\n...\n\nnew AutoDllPlugin({\n  context: path.join(__dirname, '..'),\n  entry: {\n    vendor: [\n      'react',\n      'react-dom'\n    ]\n  }\n})\n```\n\nIf you still encounter an issue with the context set up correctly, please open an issue. I'll be happy to help you.\n\n## Running Examples\n\n1. `git clone git@github.com:asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin.git`\n2. `cd autodll-webpack-plugin`\n3. `npm install`\n4. `npm run build`\n5. `cd examples/recommended`\n6. `npm install`\n7. `npm start` or `npm run build`\n\n## Contributors\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n| [<img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/199747?v=4\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Asaf Katz</b></sub>](https://twitter.com/asfktz)<br />[💻](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/commits?author=asfktz \"Code\") [👀](#review-asfktz \"Reviewed Pull Requests\") [⚠️](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/commits?author=asfktz \"Tests\") [🚇](#infra-asfktz \"Infrastructure (Hosting, Build-Tools, etc)\") | [<img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/22251956?v=4\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Suhas Karanth</b></sub>](https://github.com/sudo-suhas)<br />[💻](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/commits?author=sudo-suhas \"Code\") [🤔](#ideas-sudo-suhas \"Ideas, Planning, & Feedback\") [🐛](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/issues?q=author%3Asudo-suhas \"Bug reports\") [🚇](#infra-sudo-suhas \"Infrastructure (Hosting, Build-Tools, etc)\") [⚠️](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/commits?author=sudo-suhas \"Tests\") [🔧](#tool-sudo-suhas \"Tools\") [💬](#question-sudo-suhas \"Answering Questions\") | [<img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17503914?v=4\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Matt Heise</b></sub>](https://github.com/mhheise)<br />[💻](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/commits?author=mhheise \"Code\") | [<img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/154732?v=4\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>James Gillmore</b></sub>](http://twitter.com/faceyspacey)<br />[💻](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/commits?author=faceyspacey \"Code\") | [<img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/583657?v=4\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Jonas Pauthier</b></sub>](https://twitter.com/jonas_pauthier)<br />[🤔](#ideas-Nargonath \"Ideas, Planning, & Feedback\") [🔧](#tool-Nargonath \"Tools\") [💬](#question-Nargonath \"Answering Questions\") [📖](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/commits?author=Nargonath \"Documentation\") [🐛](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/issues?q=author%3ANargonath \"Bug reports\") | [<img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9636410?v=4\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Ade Viankakrisna Fadlil</b></sub>](https://github.com/viankakrisna)<br />[💻](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/commits?author=viankakrisna \"Code\") [🐛](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/issues?q=author%3Aviankakrisna \"Bug reports\") [🔧](#tool-viankakrisna \"Tools\") [💬](#question-viankakrisna \"Answering Questions\") | [<img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2373958?v=4\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Tryggvi Gylfason</b></sub>](https://github.com/tryggvigy)<br />[💻](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/commits?author=tryggvigy \"Code\") [💬](#question-tryggvigy \"Answering Questions\") [🐛](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/issues?q=author%3Atryggvigy \"Bug reports\") |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| [<img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1056587?v=4\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Drew Hamlett</b></sub>](https://github.com/drewhamlett)<br />[💻](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/commits?author=drewhamlett \"Code\") | [<img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8420490?v=4\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Joshua Wiens</b></sub>](https://github.com/d3viant0ne)<br />[📖](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/commits?author=d3viant0ne \"Documentation\") [💬](#question-d3viant0ne \"Answering Questions\") | [<img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/231804?v=4\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Daniel Tschinder</b></sub>](https://github.com/danez)<br />[💻](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/commits?author=danez \"Code\") | [<img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6374832?v=4\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Amila Welihinda</b></sub>](http://amilajack.com)<br />[📖](https://github.com/asfktz/autodll-webpack-plugin/commits?author=amilajack \"Documentation\") |\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->\nThis project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification.
